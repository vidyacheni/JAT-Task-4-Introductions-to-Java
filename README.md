# JAT-Task-4
Write a Java program that declares four integer variables: a, b, c, and d. Then, write an if statement that checks whether the sum of a and b is greater than the sum of c and d. If the condition is true, the program should output a message indicating that the sum of a and b is greater than the sum of c and d.
